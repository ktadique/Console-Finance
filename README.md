# Challenge 4 - Console Finances

## Description

This respositorty contains the Console Finances code which analyzes the financial records of a company. Using what I had learned in both class and self-study I was able to fulfil all the tasks in JavaScript to calculate the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

All calculations have been logged and properly formatted in the Console, to the nearest 100th.
